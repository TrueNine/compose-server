# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring MediaCMS from its current Django + React stack to a modern TypeScript and Rust architecture. MediaCMS is a comprehensive video and media content management system that supports video transcoding, user management, playlists, comments, RBAC, and various media workflows. The refactoring aims to improve performance, type safety, maintainability, and scalability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads media files THEN the system SHALL support video, audio, image, and PDF formats as currently supported
2. WHEN media is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically generate thumbnails and perform transcoding using the same profiles (144p, 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p)
3. WHEN video transcoding occurs THEN the system SHALL support multiple codecs (h264, h265, vp9) and HLS streaming
4. WHEN media processing is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same file organization structure and URL patterns
5. WHEN users access media THEN the system SHALL provide the same playback capabilities including multiple resolutions and subtitle support

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN managing background tasks THEN the system SHALL implement a job queue system equivalent to Celery functionality
6. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL efficiently handle media file serving with proper caching headers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the client application to be built with modern TypeScript and React, so that we have better type safety, developer experience, and maintainable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
2. WHEN building React components THEN the system SHALL use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
3. WHEN managing application state THEN the system SHALL use a modern state management solution (Redux Toolkit or Zustand)
4. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use a type-safe HTTP client with generated types from OpenAPI specs
5. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use Vite or similar modern build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
6. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL maintain the current responsive design with light/dark theme support

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want a well-documented REST API with OpenAPI specification, so that I can integrate with the system and understand all available endpoints and data models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL provide all current REST endpoints with the same functionality
2. WHEN documenting the API THEN the system SHALL generate OpenAPI 3.0 specification automatically from code
3. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL support the same authentication methods (session, token, basic auth)
4. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL maintain the same JSON response formats and pagination
5. WHEN validating requests THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive input validation with clear error messages
6. WHEN accessing API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide Swagger UI and ReDoc interfaces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want all current user management and authentication features to work identically, so that existing user accounts, permissions, and workflows remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL support the same login methods (username/email, SAML, social auth)
2. WHEN managing user roles THEN the system SHALL maintain the same role hierarchy (user, advanced user, editor, manager, admin)
3. WHEN implementing RBAC THEN the system SHALL preserve all role-based access control functionality for categories and media
4. WHEN users register THEN the system SHALL support the same registration workflows (open, email verification, admin approval)
5. WHEN managing user profiles THEN the system SHALL maintain all profile fields, avatars, and channel functionality
6. WHEN handling notifications THEN the system SHALL preserve email notification preferences and functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want all media organization features to work the same way, so that I can continue using categories, tags, playlists, and comments as before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing media THEN the system SHALL support the same category and tag system with hierarchical categories
2. WHEN creating playlists THEN the system SHALL maintain playlist functionality with the same media limits and ordering
3. WHEN adding comments THEN the system SHALL preserve comment threading, mentions, and moderation features
4. WHEN rating content THEN the system SHALL maintain the like/dislike system and reporting functionality
5. WHEN searching content THEN the system SHALL provide the same search capabilities with filters and live search
6. WHEN managing media permissions THEN the system SHALL preserve individual media sharing and permission settings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the same configuration and management capabilities, so that I can maintain portal settings, encoding profiles, and system monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the portal THEN the system SHALL support the same configuration options (themes, logos, workflows, limits)
2. WHEN managing encoding THEN the system SHALL maintain the same encoding profile system with customizable resolutions and codecs
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent task monitoring and management interfaces
4. WHEN managing content THEN the system SHALL preserve bulk actions, content moderation, and admin management views
5. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL support the same chunked upload system with resumable uploads
6. WHEN configuring workflows THEN the system SHALL maintain public, private, and unlisted content workflows

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the refactored system to maintain deployment compatibility, so that existing Docker and infrastructure setups continue to work with minimal changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN the system SHALL provide Docker containers with the same external interface
2. WHEN configuring the database THEN the system SHALL use the same PostgreSQL schema with migration support
3. WHEN setting up caching THEN the system SHALL integrate with Redis for the same caching and session functionality
4. WHEN handling static files THEN the system SHALL work with the same Nginx configuration patterns
