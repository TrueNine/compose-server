## Core Working Principles

## Communication Efficiency Optimization
- All responses must be concise and direct
- Prioritize answering core questions, avoid redundant explanations
- Batch process related tasks to reduce interaction rounds

## Token Saving Strategies
- Avoid repeating known information
- Use concise technical terms instead of lengthy explanations
- Merge multiple related modifications into single operations
- Omit obvious step descriptions
- Use code examples instead of text descriptions

# General Code Standards

## Programming Principles
- Prefer early return to reduce nesting
- Single responsibility for functions, limit parameters to 5 or fewer
- Prohibit hardcoded constants, use configuration or constant definitions
- Clear error handling, avoid silent failures

## Code Style Consistency
- Follow existing project code style and conventions
- Maintain consistent indentation format with project
- Organize import statements according to project standards
- Match comment style with language ecosystem

## Security Programming Guidelines
- Strictly prohibit exposing sensitive information in code (keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- Input validation and output escaping
- Permission checks and boundary condition handling

# Database Standards

## SQL Writing Standards
- Use lowercase keywords and identifiers consistently
- Use snake_case naming convention
- Must use parameterized queries, strictly prohibit string concatenation
- Table names and field names should be concise and clear, avoid abbreviations
- Add comments for important fields

# Documentation and Comments

## Comment Standards
- API documentation comments use English
- Code logic comments use local language or English
- Comments explain "why" not "what"
- Avoid obvious comments

## Document Structure
- Use flat structure, avoid deep nesting
- Content should be accurate and concise, eliminate ambiguity
- Use consistent terminology, avoid synonym confusion

# Quality Assurance

## Code Review Points
- Logic correctness and boundary conditions
- Performance impact and resource usage
- Security vulnerabilities and data leak risks
- Code readability and maintainability

## Technology Selection Principles
- Prioritize mature and stable technology solutions
- Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity
- Consider team technology stack and maintenance costs
